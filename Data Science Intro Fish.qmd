## Answering Questions

I think being a data scientist is about using data to make observations, gain insights, and learn about potential relationships and patterns. There is also a heavy aspect of coding

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

In terms of how I view myself in relation to these two areas, I feel like a statistician.

## R Code Chunks

Here, I pasted the code from the assignment.

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

In the code chunk above, I created an object y that takes on the values of pedal widths from a very popular R data set, iris. Then, I checked the class, type, and structure of this newly defined object.

Below, I am going to plot this object.

```{r}
#| echo: false
plot(y)
```
