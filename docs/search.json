    "text": "I think being a data scientist is about using data to make observations, gain insights, and learn about potential relationships and patterns. There is so much to data science as a discipline that all works together to create the overarching picture of the subject: coding, modeling, analysis, data cleaning, model writing, etc.. With that in mine, being a data scientist to me starts with the desire to want to learn something more from data than what originally meets the eye.\nBetween data scientists and statisticians, there are many similarities. To start, many statistics courses nowadays use R, SAS, and other languages in order to analyze data and make conclusions; I presume data scientists do the same. However, statistics seems more preoccupied with forming a nicely worded conclusion from a previously stated hypothesis, whereas data science is moreso aiming to analyze large data sets for any underlying information. Also, data scientists seem to have a wide range of skills for automation of tasks and analysis/cleaning of large data sets, while statistics seems to follow a structured series of tasks in order to complete a specific analysis.\nI definitely see myself as more of a statistician than a data scientist. I honestly still struggle with how to decipher the two, but I know that I have much more confidence in my ability to solve a statistics problem as opposed to a data science problem. In reality, though, data scientist positions are becoming more and more useful/desirable as they have a wide range of capabilities, so I hope to change this answer sooner rather than later!"
